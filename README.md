# fragments-ui

This repo will be used for the purpose of creating a simple web app to manage authentication with our User Pool and test our back-end fragments microservice.

To Start and run the server :- npx parcel src/index.html

I have automated building the images and uploading the image to docker hub registory using CI and I have also automated building images and uploading the image to AMS ECR registory using CD.
